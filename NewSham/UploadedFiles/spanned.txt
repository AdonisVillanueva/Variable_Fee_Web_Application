<br /><br /><br /><div style="MARGIN-TOP: 200px"><p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">Daniel Patton doesn’t believe that simple luck brought him to the Union Rescue Mission in Downtown Los Angeles’ Skid Row. After suffering from drug addiction, alcohol abuse and homelessness, he says that finding the organization that helped him turn his life around was no accident.</font></p>
<p><span class="profileBody"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&#160;“I had made a lot of bad decisions, and things had really gone downhill,” Patton recalls. “God guided me here when everyone else had turned their backs on me.”</font></span></p>
<p><span class="profileBody"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&#160;The URM, operating for over 100 years, is the oldest rescue mission in Los Angeles and one of the largest of its kind in the country. Services for its poor and homeless residents include the USC/URM Dental Clinic, which provides dental services free of charge to URM program participants and residents of other nearby homeless shelters.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="profileBody"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&#160;After his first nine days at the URM, Patton was referred to the dental clinic. His last dental visit prior to visiting the clinic had been for a crown placement, a Christmas present from his late father three or four years ago, he says. Lack of insurance prevented any further dental care until coming to the URM.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="profileBody"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&#160;“They took X-rays and cleaned my teeth,” he recalls. “They had to fill three teeth and extract another one.”</font></span></p>
<p><span class="profileBody"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&#160;Patton says the treatment has had lasting effects, aesthetic and emotional.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="profileBody"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&#160;“It’s increased my self esteem,” he says. “I can smile and really feel good, outside and inside.”</font></span></p>
<p><span class="profileBody"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&#160;Patton’s treatment and rehabilitation has gone very well, and he now serves about 30 of his fellow residents as a coordinator, helping them to take advantage of all the services that the URM has to offer. He hopes that his own life changes – complete with a GED in the works -- will be a positive example to others in tough circumstances and will motivate them to become self-sufficient.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="profileBody"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">&#160;“I’m so thankful for a place like this and an opportunity to be of service,” he says. “God wants me to prosper, and I’m loving life. I want others to know that no matter what problems you have, there truly is a way out.”</font></span></p>
